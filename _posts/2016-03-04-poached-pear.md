Makes 6 whole pears, or can cook cut into in thirds

//

- 750 ml dry white wine

- 2.25 tbsp freshly squeezed lemon juice 

- 225 g superfine sugar

- 22 cardamom pods, lightly crushed

- 0.75 tsp saffron threads

- pinch of salt

- 6 firm pears, peeled

- crème fraîche, to serve

//

Pour the wine and lemon juice into a medium saucepan and add the sugar, cardamom, saffron, and salt. 

Bring to a light simmer and place the pears in the pan. Make sure they are immersed in the liquid; add water if needed. 

Cover the surface with a disk of waxed paper and simmer the pears, turning them occasionally, for 15 to 25 minutes, until they are cooked through but not mushy. To check if the pears are ready, insert a knife into the flesh; it should slide in smoothly.

Remove the pears from the liquid and transfer to four serving bowls. 

Increase the heat and reduce the liquid by about two-thirds, or until thick and syrupy. 

Pour over the pears and leave to cool down. 

Serve cold or at room temperature. Can serve with yoghurt pudding and saffron syrup, with crushed pistachios.
