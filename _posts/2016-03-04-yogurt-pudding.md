================

To serve 4 

---

- 4 sheets (leaves) gelatin (0.2 oz / 7 g in total)

- 200 ml heavy cream

- 200 ml whole milk

- 90 g superfine sugar

- grated zest of a lemon

- 200 g Greek yogurt

- 20 g slivered Iranian (or crushed regular) pistachios


Place the gelatin sheets in a bowl with plenty of cold water and leave to soften for a few minutes.

Pour the cream and milk into a small saucepan and add the sugar and the lemon zest. Place over medium heat, bring to a simmer, and remove immediately from the heat. 

Put the yogurt in a medium mixing bowl and whisk constantly as you pour in the hot milk and cream in a slow stream. Squeeze the water out of the gelatin sheets, add them to the bowl, and stir until they dissolve completely.

Pour the mixture into 4 150ml individual molds (darioles or ramekins) and leave to set in the fridge for at least 5 hours. You can also leave them in the fridge overnight, covered with plastic wrap.

When ready to serve, dip the molds in a bowl of hot water for a minute or two to assist in tipping out the puddings. Turn them over onto individual serving plates. You may need to shake the molds gently; donâ€™t worry, the puddings will come out eventually. 

Serve with poached pears, syrup and pistachios.
