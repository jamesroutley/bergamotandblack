Pitt Cue Co chipotle ketchup, also used to make BBQ sauce. We use chipotle paste rather than chipotle peppers because it's easier to find.

//

- 1kg ripe tomatoes, chopped

- 250g onions, peeled, chopped

- 250g cooking apples, peeled, cored, chopped

- 2 or more tbsp chipotle paste

- 250ml cider vinegar

- 25g smoked Maldon sea salt (or normal)

- 25g hot smoked paprika

- 250g light muscovado sugar

Place all the ingredients apart from the sugar and the chipotle paste into a pan and bring to a gentle simmer.

Simmer for 2 hours and then blend with a stick blender.

Add the sugar and the chipotle paste to taste and cook for around 30 minutes, stirring so it doesn't stick.

Decant into sterilised jars and seal.

Ideally refrigerate for a few days before using to allow the flavours to blend.

Keeps for 2 weeks.
