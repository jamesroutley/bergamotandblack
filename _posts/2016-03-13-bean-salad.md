================


- 200g french beans, topped 

- 300g broad beans (fresh or frozen)

- 50g baby spinach leaves 

- 1 shallot, peeled, very thinly sliced 

- 1 red chilli, finely diced 

- Â½ tsp sesame oil 

- 3 tbsp olive oil 

- 1 tbsp lemon juice 

- 1 tbsp sesame seeds, toasted 

- 1 tsp nigella seeds

- salt

- optional: 300g asparagus, trimmed and sliced on a sharp angle into 3-4 thin spears

If using the asparagus, blanch in a large pot of boiling water for 2-4 minutes, then transfer to a bowl of iced cold water.

Blanch the french beans in the boilling water for 5 minutes then transfer to the iced water.

Blanch the broad beans for 2 minutes. You will need to refresh these in a different bowl of cold water (to keep them together when you want to skin them).

Remove the broad beans' skins and add all the greens to the serving bowl.

Add the remaining ingredients with half a tsp of salt. Stir and taste, add more salt if necessary. Serve at once.
