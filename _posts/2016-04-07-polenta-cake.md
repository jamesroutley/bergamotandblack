Line the base of the cake tin with a piece of baking parchment. Set the oven at 180C/Gas 4. 

Beat the butter and sugar till light and fluffy. Add the ground almonds and flaked almonds.

Lightly beat the eggs, then stir into the mixture.

Mix the polenta and baking powder, then fold into the mixture, together with the grated orange zest and juice. 

Crush the cardamom pods and extract the seeds, grinding them to a fine powder. Add the spice to the cake mixture. 

Transfer the cake mixture to the lined tin and smooth the top level. 

Bake for 30 minutes, then turn down the heat to 160C/gas 3 for a further 25 -30 minutes or until the cake is firm. 

To make the syrup, squeeze the lemon and orange juice into a stainless steel saucepan, bring to the boil and dissolve in the honey. 

Keep the liquid boiling until it has formed a thin syrup (4-5 minutes). 

Spike holes into the top of the cake (still warm and in its tin) with a skewer then spoon over the hot citrus syrup. Leave to almost cool, then lift out of the tin. 

To serve, whip mascarpone with a little sugar and serve the cake in thick slices with a dollop of mascarpone and mint leaf tops.
