Makes quite a lot.

- 1.5 cups double cream
- 1.5 cups whole milk
- 0.5 cups sugar
- 4 egg yolks
- 1 cup stilton

//

Heat cream and milk until small bubbles form and burst. Do not boil. While cream is heating, whisk egg yolks and sugar until pale and creamy. Temper eggs by slowly whisking in 0.5 cups of the milk and cream mixture. Reduce heat to low, whisk eggs into milk and cream. Continue cooking until the mixture thickens to coat the back of a spoon. Cool mixture in the fridge. Churn.

Serve with fig jam, walnut crumb, celery leaf.
