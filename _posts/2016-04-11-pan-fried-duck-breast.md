Makes enough for two as a main or four as part of a multi course meal.

- 2 duck breasts
- equal parts salt
- equal parts brown sugar
- curing spices (bay, star anise, orange zest, black pepper, sichuan peppercorn etc)

//

Dry the duck breasts. Mix cure ingredients. Pour half of the cure onto a non-reactive plate, place the duck breasts on it an cover with the remaining cure. Let sit for 30 minutes.

Rinse breasts to remove cure. Place on a plate skin side up uncovered in the fridge or by an open window for the skin to dry for a couple of hours; the skin should feel like paper.

Heat a pan over medium heat. Cook duck skin side down for 5 mins, then on the other side for 3. The sugar in the cure caramelises quickly. Rest for five minutes. Slice on a bias and serve.
